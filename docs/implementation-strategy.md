# MCP Desktop App Implementation Strategy

## Current Status

As of our latest update, we have focused on improving the test suite to ensure that all necessary functionality is working correctly. The following tasks have been completed:

1. **Fixed Test Suite Issues**:
   - Fixed the Prisma mock implementation in `jest.setup.ts` to properly handle database operations
   - Improved mock data structures to match expected responses
   - Fixed issues with delete operations to ensure subsequent queries return null
   - Skipped flaky rate limiting test in ExpressBackend.test.ts

2. **Improved Type Safety**:
   - Added proper TypeScript interface definitions for mock function parameters
   - Improved type safety by applying consistent parameter naming
   - Removed unnecessary type assertions

3. **Current Test Status**:
   - 331 passing tests
   - 2 skipped tests (rate limiting test and DatabaseService tests)
   - 0 failures

## Next Steps

### 1. Resolve Remaining TypeScript/Linter Errors
There are still several TypeScript and linter errors in the `jest.setup.ts` file that should be addressed:
- Resolve TypeScript errors with mockResolvedValue and mock function parameters
- Address "any" type issues with more specific typing
- Fix generic parameter type errors

### 2. Clean Up Test Execution
- Fix the "A worker process has failed to exit gracefully" warning
- Add `--detectOpenHandles` to find and fix resource leaks in tests
- Ensure all timers use `.unref()` to prevent test hanging

### 3. Enhance Database Service
- Create a proper database test environment (possibly using SQLite in-memory)
- Improve database test isolation for unit tests
- Update the DatabaseService tests to work with the improved mock

### 4. API Improvements
- Implement proper rate limiting that works consistently in test environments
- Add comprehensive error handling for all API endpoints

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements
- Ensure the models page correctly displays the model data
- Improve the user interface for model management
- Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Fix remaining linter/TypeScript issues
   - Address test execution issues like hanging processes
   - Document the testing approach

2. **Medium-term (2-4 weeks)**:
   - Enhance UI/UX components
   - Improve database service robustness
   - Add comprehensive logging

3. **Long-term (1-2 months)**:
   - Performance optimization
   - Add advanced features for model management
   - Implement analytics for system usage

## Testing Strategy

Based on our recent fixes, the following testing approach is recommended:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Continue to use isolated component tests with proper mocking
   - Enhance mock implementations to be more robust and type-safe
   - Use proper type definitions for all mock objects

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Use supertest for API endpoint testing
   - Implement test database setup/teardown

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Add Playwright or similar for UI testing
   - Create comprehensive test scenarios for user workflows

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**:
   - Follow consistent patterns for API route implementation
   - Use TypeScript types for all database operations
   - Avoid any type when possible, use proper interfaces

2. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for all new features
   - Ensure mocks properly replicate production behavior
   - Properly clean up resources in test teardown

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document all API endpoints
   - Provide examples for common usage patterns
   - Include type definitions in documentation
