## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript
- React Testing Library for components
- Prisma tests for database operations

### Integration Testing
- Supertest for API testing
- Electron-specific integration tests
- Database integration tests

### E2E Testing
- Playwright for UI testing
- Full workflow testing
- Cross-platform verification

### Performance Testing
- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU utilization checks
- Database performance metrics

## Development Workflow

1. Feature Branch Creation
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/phase-{number}-{feature-name}
   ```

2. Implementation
   - Write tests first
   - Implement feature
   - Document changes

3. Testing
   - Run unit tests
   - Run integration tests
   - Manual testing

4. Code Review
   - Self-review
   - Peer review if available
   - Documentation review

5. Merge
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/phase-{number}-{feature-name}
   ```

## Rollback Strategy

### For Each Phase
1. Database migrations have down functions
2. Feature flags for major changes
3. Version tagging for releases

### Backup Points
